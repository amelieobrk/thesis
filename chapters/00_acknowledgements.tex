    I would like to thank my supervisor Shiying for her guidance and support throughout this work.

    Thank you to Leon, Jonas and Lukas, whose commitment and daily companionship in the library provided both motivation and encouragement during the last months.

   I would also like to thank Lena and Franzi for their continuous encouragement and friendship and Alba, Lara, and Leon, for being my supportive home environment during this period.

    And finally thank you to Jan and my family, whose encouragement and constant support have been indispensable throughout this journey.
